# generative-intention-resolution

This repository contains the dataset and code from the paper ["Is the Pope Catholic? Yes, the Pope is Catholic.
Generative Evaluation of Non-Literal Intent Resolution in LLMs"](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-short.26.pdf) accepted at ACL 2024.

## Data

The original dataset is from ["A fine-grained comparison of pragmatic language understanding
in humans and language models"](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.230.pdf). This data includes only  a single non-literal utterance U<sub>1</sub><sup>N</sup>
, and verbalized intents that include a literal intent
I<sub>L</sub> and true intent I<sub>T</sub>.

To instantiate our framework in our paper,
we augment this data with dialog chains (U<sub>1</sub><sup>L</sup>, U<sub>2</sub><sup>L</sup>)
conditioned on the literal intent I<sub>L</sub> and (U<sub>1</sub><sup>T</sup>, U<sub>2</sub><sup>T</sup>)
conditioned on the true intent I<sub>T</sub> . We use GPT-4 to get reference chains. 

The data is available at `data/hu_gpt4augmented_turn2_data.csv`. Additional details about this generation can be found in the paper in Appendix A.2. 

## Code to generate responses using LLMs
To evaluate LLMs' capabilities for non-literal intent understanding, we generate candidate
listener turn-2 responses U<sub>2</sub><sup>N</sup> using state-of-the-art models available at the time, given the preceding context `C` and the speakerâ€™s non-literal utterance U<sub>N</sub>. The code is available at `code/generate_model_turn2_responses.py` and additional details in Appendix A.3. 

## LLM-as-a-judge
We find that contextual similarity with GPT-4 and non-contextual embedding similarity with Llama-3-8B-Instruct correlated best with human validation. We provide code for GPT-4 as a judge at `code/run_gpt4_eval.py`
